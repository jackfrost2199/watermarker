# Watermarker
HTML/JavaScript/CSS software that can generate watermarks for synthetic genomics.

Information such as melting temperatures, species, and amplification region sizes can be entered into the program allowing you to re-code a nucleic acid sequence into a synonomous version that varies significantly from one found in nature.  PCR aplification of this watermarked gene or nucleotide segment can provide evidence that your transfection was successful.

Demo version running [here](http://54.201.79.239/watermarker/).
